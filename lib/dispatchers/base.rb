    # The Base dispatcher simply makes it easier to write dispatchers by inheriting
    # from it. It creates a Waves request, ensures the request processing is done
    # within a mutex, benchmarks the request processing, logs it, and handles common
    # exceptions and redirects. Derived classes need only process the request within
    # their +safe+ method, which takes a Waves::Request and returns a Waves::Response.

      # taking an +env+ parameter.
