module Waves

  # Waves::Mapping is a mixin for defining Waves URI mappings (mapping a request to Ruby code).
  # Mappings can work against the request url, path, and elements of the request (such as the
  # request method or accept header). Mappings may also include before, after, or wrap filters
  # to be run if they match the request. Mappings are created using an appropriate mapping method
  # along with a URL pattern (a string or regular expression), a hash of constraint options, and
  # a block, which is the code to run if the pattern matches.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #   resource = '([\w\-]+)'
  #   name = '([\w\-\_\.\+\@]+)'
  #
  #   path %r{^/#{resource}/#{name}/?$} do |resource, name|
  #     "Hello from a #{resource} named #{name.capitalize}."
  #   end
  #
  # In this example, we are using binding regular expressions defined by +resource+
  # and +name+. The matches are passed into the block as parameters. Thus, this
  # rule, given the URL '/person/john' will return:
  #
  #   Hello from a person named John.
  #
  # The given block may simple return a string. The content type is inferred from the request
  # if possible, otherwise it defaults to +text+/+html+.
  #
  #   path '/critters', :method => :post do
  #     request.content_type
  #   end
  #
  #   /critters # => 'text/html'
  #
  # In this example, we match against a string and check to make sure that the request is a
  # POST. If so, we return the request content_type. The request (and response) objects are
  # available from within the block implicitly.
  #
  # = Invoking Controllers and Views
  #
  # You may invoke a controller or view method for the primary application by using the
  # corresponding methods, preceded by the +use+ directive.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #   path %r{^/#{resource}/#{name}/?$} do |resource, name|
  #     resource( resource ) do
  #       controller { find( name ) } |  view { | instance | show( resource => instance ) }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In this example, we take the same rule from above but invoke a controller and view method.
  # We use the +resource+ directive and the resource parameter to set the MVC instances we're going
  # to use. This is necessary to use the +controller+ or +view+ methods. Each of these take
  # a block as arguments which are evaluated in the context of the instance. The +view+ method
  # can further take an argument which is "piped" from the result of the controller block. This
  # isn't required, but helps to clarify the request processing. Within a view block, a hash
  # may also be passed in to the view method, which is converted into instance variables for the
  # view instance. In this example, the +show+ method is assigned to an instance variable with the
  # same name as the resource type.
  #
  # So given the same URL as above - /person/john - what will happen is the +find+ method for
  # the +Person+ controller will be invoked and the result passed to the +Person+ view's +show+
  # method, with +@person+ holding the value returned.
  #
  # Crucially, the controller does not need to know what variables the view depends on. This is
  # the job of the mapping block, to act as the "glue" between the controller and view. The
  # controller and view can thus be completely decoupled and become easier to reuse separately.
  #
  #   url 'http://admin.foobar.com:/' do
  #     resource( :admin ) { view { console } }
  #   end
  #
  # In this example, we are using the +url+ method to map a subdomain of +foobar.com+ to the
  # console method of the Admin view. In this case, we did not need a controller method, so
  # we simply didn't call one.
  #
  # = Mapping Modules
  #
  # You may encapsulate sets of related rules into modules and simply include them into your
  # mapping module. Some rule sets come packaged with Waves, such as PrettyUrls (rules for
  # matching resources using names instead of ids). The simplest way to define such modules for
  # reuse is by defining the +included+ class method for the rules module, and then define
  # the rules using +module_eval+. See the PrettyUrls module for an example of how to do this.
  #
  # *Important:* Using pre-packaged mapping rules does not prevent you from adding to or
  # overriding these rules. However, order does matter, so you should put your own rules
  # ahead of those your may be importing. Also, place rules with constraints (for example,
  # rules that require a POST) ahead of those with no constraints, otherwise the constrainted
  # rules may never be called.

    # If the pattern matches and constraints given by the options hash are satisfied, run the
    # block before running any +path+ or +url+ actions. You can have as many +before+ matches
    # as you want - they will all run, unless one of them calls redirect, generates an
    # unhandled exception, etc.
    def before( path, options = {}, &block )
      mappings[:before] << [ merge( path, options ), block ]
